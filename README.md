## This is not my extension

The source code of chrome extensions is easily downloaded; it is Javascript after all. This is a copy of the extention [Tab Active](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-activate/jlmadbnpnnolpaljadgakjilggigioaj) with a fix for Chrome 79's new `pendingUrl` field (starting Chrome 79.0.3945.79). This is going up on my Github so I can download it where I need it until the fix comes.
